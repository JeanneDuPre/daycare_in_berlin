# Daycare in Berlin

### Overview of daycare in Berlin
#### The state of Berlin operates 9.65% of the self-operated facilities in Berlin. Despite the legal entitlement to a daycare slot from the first year of life, the state of Berlin administers only 9.65% of the daycare facilities in Berlin as so-called self-operated facilities. The majority, amounting to 60.68%, is covered by other independent sponsors, and 18.27% by parent initiatives.

### Distribution of daycare/kindergarten places and children to be cared for
#### In Berlin, sufficient childcare places have only been provided in the districts of Mitte and Pankow. Conversely, ten additional districts exhibit a significant undersupply in childcare services. The available data solely pertains to the age range of 0 to 5 years. Considering that in Berlin, entitlement to a childcare place begins at the age of one, and children aged 6 are not individually accounted for, this discrepancy can be disregarded in this context.
